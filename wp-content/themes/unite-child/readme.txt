It is a highly customizable theme with unlimited color variations that can be tweaked via simple yet powerful Theme Options. Theme has a built-in Popular Posts Widget, Infinite Scroll (powered by Jatpack) and translation support. It's now available in German and French. Theme features fancy image slider, SEO friendly structure, logo support, social links and widgetized homepage.  This theme was built to be used for wedding related websites but can be tweaked to be used as any other image-centric blog such as travel.

/*========= Installation =========*/

You can install the theme through the WordPress installer under "Themes" > "Install themes" by searching for "Unite".

Alternatively you can download the file, unzip it and move the unzipped contents to the "wp-content/themes" folder of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the theme.

This theme relies on Options Framework by WP Theming to provide customization options.
Right after you activate Unite, you'll see message on top of your screen, asking you to install Options Framework (required) and CPT Bootstrap Carousel (optional). Make sure you install and activate those plugins.

If you dismiss this notice, you can install those plugins later via Appearance->Install plugins.
